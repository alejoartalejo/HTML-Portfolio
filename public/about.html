<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Alejo Artalejo. I graduated Winston Churchill Highschool as of May 2023 with a 4.0 GPA. I plan on attending
  San Antonio College for my first two years and want to finish my last two years at UTSA where I hope to 
get my Bachelors in Science Degree for my computer science major. </p>

<p>Some of my hobbies or things I enjoy doing include weightlifting, cars, and driving fun cars. 
  I have been weight-lifting for about four years now, but really started to get into it on August 2022. I try and go
   relatively consistently to avoid getting lazy and forming bad habits. As for cars and driving they go hand and hand. 
   I love looking at JDM as well as classic american muscle cars as well as I would like to be able to drive them one day.
